#How To Install Premium Landing Page Templates For InboundNow
This guide is meant for people that use the free version of the plugin Landing Pages by InboundNow. The free Landing Pages plugin comes with a number of free landing pages included. They usually are basic pages with limited customization options. Users of the plugin can access our marketplace and buy any premium template which must be downloaded and installed using the procedure in this documentation. Subscribers to any of our [paid plans](http://www.inboundnow.com/pricing/) have already access to all the premium templates for all of our plugins, so they don't need this guide. If you need more than one of our premium templates, or one-click easy installations of premium templatesm, please consider subscribing to one of our [paid plans](http://www.inboundnow.com/pricing/). With an active premium membership you will have immediate access to all of Inbound Now's feature extensions and premium templates.

##Difference Between Landing Pages Free And Premium
Our templating system uses the plugin [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) to manage all the template's customization options. It is important to note that the free version of the Landing Pages plugin that we serve from the [WordPress Repo](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/landing-pages/) comes with the ACF Lite bundled while the premium version comes with ACF PRO version 5. The big difference between the two versions of ACF is that ACF free does not support the flexible and repeater fields that are required for most premium templates.

##Installing a Premium Template With Landing Pages Free
To solve the problem of the missing ACF PRO plugin and guarantee that our premium templates work with Landing Pages free we have created a plugin that installs all the ACF PRO libraries needed to make our template work. This is permitted through [Advanced Custom Fields licence agreement] (http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/including-acf-in-a-plugin-theme/).

When you buy one of our premium templates you have two files to download, one is the template file, and one is called `inbound-premium-template-support.zip`. 

Once you have downloaded the two files, please follow these steps:
> 1. Install the file `inbound-premium-template-support.zip` like a normal plugin, and activate it
> 2. Go to the dashboard menu `Landing Pages > Manage Templates`
> 3. Click on `Add New Template` at the top of the page, and install the template file.
> 4. DON'T try to install the file `inbound-premium-template-support.zip` as a new template. Doing so will break the plugin
> 5. Enjoy your new premium template

**Note 1:** If you have already a premium template installed and working you can skip step 1 because the support extension is already installed.

**Note 2:** If you have bought and installed the plugin ACF PRO in your website you can skip step 1 because you don't need the support extension.

**Note 3:** If you are running our all-in-one master plugin and have an active api key enabled with any level of paid subscription activated then you will not need to install the helper extension. ACF Pro will be automatically loaded and your premium template's settings will work. 

That's all there is to it. Our premium templates are made for people that don't know how or don't have time to write code. You'll be able to create complex and professional landing pages by combining sections in the order and number that you want like Lego blocks, each section with different colors, text and pictures.
